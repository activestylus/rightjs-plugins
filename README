Welcome !
=========

RightJS goods is a collection of additional plugins and features for the
RightJS framework which are not included in the standard build but still an
actual part of the project.

All the features will be available as standalone modules as well as in form
of the custom build options.

Builds
======

All the freshest builds of the project are available at the home page

http://rightjs.org/goods


If you need to build the things by yourself, you'll need Ruby and Rake
tools, after that say in the console the following

git submodule init
git submodule update

rake build
